# Instrumentation Comparison Utilities

These scripts allow the extraction of instrumentation probe counts for each function.
This can be used to compare the configuration fo different binaries.

For a quick summary, call `instcmpsym.sh` with the two exutables to compare.

## Usage

### Collecting probe counts
Usage: `inststats.sh [exe] ([probe_name])`

Extract instrumentation metrics for the given executable. If `probe_name` is not specified, "__cyg_profile_func_enter" is used.

### Comparing binaries
Usage: `instcmp.sh [fileA] [fileB] ([filterOutDotFns] [filterOutStdFns])`

Compare two instrumentation statistics generated by `inststats.sh`. By default, function containing `.` or residing in the `std` namespace are not considered (disable filtering by passing `0` respectively).

### Symmetric comparison summary 
Usage: `instcmpsym.sh [exeA] [exeB] ([probe_name] [filterOutDotFns] [filterOutStdFns])`

Print summary of comparison A <-> B and B <-> A. Expects two ELF binaries as input.
